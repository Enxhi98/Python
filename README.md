# Python2
I am using this repository to store my Python programs which I practice at university and home.
Github helps me to find my files and programs whenever I need to. 
What is more advantageous is that I can access my repositories everywhere from all kinds of devices. 
This way I do not have to store too much data in my computer's storage.
